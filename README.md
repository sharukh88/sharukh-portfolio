# Sharukh Khan — Data Analyst Portfolio

A clean, responsive personal portfolio website showcasing experience, analytics projects, education, skills, and contact information.

## Overview

This project is a static portfolio site built with semantic HTML, custom CSS, and a small JavaScript enhancement for active navigation state on scroll.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- Bootstrap 5 (CDN)

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — Main page layout and content
- `styles.css` — Custom styling and responsive polish
- `script.js` — Navbar active-section highlighting logic
- `images/` — Logos and static image assets

## Features

- Responsive single-page layout
- Professional section hierarchy (Hero, Experience, Projects, Education, Skills, Contact)
- Card-based project and experience presentation
- Skill tags for quick technical scanning
- Scroll-aware active navigation state
- Accessible focus styles and mobile-friendly button behavior

## Run Locally

Because this is a static site, you can run it directly in a browser.

### Option 1: Open directly

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.

### Option 2: Use a local server (recommended)

If you have Python installed:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

1. Push your latest changes to GitHub.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Set source to the correct branch/folder (commonly `main` / root).
4. Wait for the Pages deployment to complete.

## Customization Notes

- Update text/content in `index.html`.
- Adjust colors and spacing via CSS variables in `styles.css`.
- Keep interactive behavior minimal and maintainable in `script.js`.
